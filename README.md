# [Tamjai Samgor Loyalty Program Evaluation]()

This is a group project to evaluate the current problems of TamJai's loyalty program and propose possible solutions to resolve those problems and also come up with innovative e-CRM stategies to further improve the loyalty program.

* Data was collected by web scrapping the ratings & comments from Google Play.
* Translate the comments from Chinese to English to ensure the data consistency and rephrase some sentences to enhance the accuracy of problem classification.
* Define different problem categories and leverage the LLM to do sentiment analysis and classification.
* Check the accuracy of the classification result and relabel the problem categories manually.
